## HEROKU LINK
https://gentle-oasis-22249.herokuapp.com/

### How to Use
        You can navigate to the herkou website found at the top of the readme.

        From there you can add burgers using the input box found at the bottom of the page. They will appear in our "yummy" column which will create a burger with the name given and you can "devour" the burger using the button to the side of it. Once devoured it will add it into the "look what I ate" column. All of these functions happen using mysql and handlebars updating and creating inside of a database.
